			<h2>CrappleOS</h2>
			<p>CrappleOS an virtual operating system and is fully capable of saving, loading, running and editing file. For writing programs it uses my very own custom language called JANK, which you can find documentation included in the download .zip.</p>
			<p>A a quirk to be careful of is that there is some weirdness to writing code in the very first and last line, and so its standard practive to leave these blank.</p>
			<p>The lessons I learnt working on CrappleOS have aided me in greatly in my new virtual OS project ShipOS.</p>
			<p>You can view the changelog <a href="./CrappleChangeLog.html">here</a></p>
