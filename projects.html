			<h2>Crapple OS</h2>
			<p>Crapple is fully capable of saving, loading, running and editing file. For writing programs it uses my very own custom language called JANK, which you can find documentation included in the download .zip.</p>
			<p>A a quirk to be careful of is that there is some weirdness to writing code in the very first and last line, and so its standard practive to leave these blank.</p>
			<p>You can view the changelog <a href="./CrappleChangeLog.html">here</a></p>

			<p>There is an issue with saved files not being found with the 'ls' function. They can still be saved, loaded and run though.</p>

			<h2>VSWS Red</h2>
			<p>VSWS Red is my version of <a href="http://verysimplewebserver.com/" target="_blank">VSWS</a>. I've added small little improvements that make the use of it easier for me. The things that I've changed are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changed the colour scheme to make it easier on the eyes.</li>
				<li>Fixed the arrows drawing invisibly at the wrong location on the tabs</li>
				<li>Made the icons match.</li>
				<li>Fixed the webserver ignoring any custom 404.html in any directory.</li>
				<li>Added automatic updating.</li>
				<li>Realised the potential of the text boxes on the config page.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are more things that I want to add to the Red version of VSWS. Some of these are:</p>
				<li>Themes.</li>
				<li>More customisation options.</li>
			<p>I'll try to keep this version up to date with the main line, but I don't promise anything.</p>
			<p>Props to Br&#128065;an for the original version.</p>

			<h2>PlayerForms</h2>
			<p>PlayerForms is a extension for GMS:2, for getting text input from the player without having to use the default get_string() function. I'll add things to this as I want/need them</p>
			<p>Although I haven't worked on this in ages, I do plan one day to get a working, useful and stable version of this avaliable.</p>

			<h2>Crazy Eight Collector</h2>
			<p>Crazy Eight Collector is a small falling block game that I made for the <a href="https://gm48.net/games/33/collect">33rd</a> <a href="https://gm48.net/">GM48</a>. I later released the game, more polished and balanced, to <a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> for a dollar.</p>
